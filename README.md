## Emulator Integration

This starter includes everything except the actual emulator logic.
To enable ROM playing, youâ€™ll need to integrate [n64js](https://github.com/hulkholden/n64js):

1. Download the [n64js build](https://github.com/hulkholden/n64js).
2. Place the emulatorâ€™s files in `public/` or `src/` as per documentation.
3. In `EmulatorCanvas.js`, use the n64js API to mount the emulator to the canvas and load ROM files.

DO NOT feel free to ask for detailed integration help!

## Legal Notice

Do NOT upload or distribute commercial/copyrighted ROMs.
Only use games you legally own or public domain/homebrew ROMs.
